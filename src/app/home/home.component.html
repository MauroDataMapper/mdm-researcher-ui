<h1>Welcome to the DataLoch Metadata Catalogue!</h1>
<p class="lead">This catalogue describes the data curated by DataLoch. For more information about why and how we use this data please see our website: <a href="http://dataloch.co.uk">dataloch.co.uk</a>.</p>
<p class="lead">Our aim is to be as transparent as possible about the data we hold, what it means in “real life”, and its quality. We believe by capturing and sharing a detailed and nuanced understanding of the data, 
our users will be able to deliver true value back to the citizens of our region. But we can’t do this alone – we are asking users to share useful insights with the whole community by suggesting improvements to this metadata by contacting 
<a href="mailto:dataloch@ed.ac.uk">dataloch@ed.ac.uk</a>.</p>
 
<h2>How to navigate the Metadata Catalogue</h2>
<p class="lead">Each dataset has its own page. You can search and/or browse under the “Search” tab. 
Some datasets are linked, either because one has been derived from another, or because they have come from the same data provider. You can explore the data by navigating between these linked datasets.</p>
 
<h2>How to select datasets for an application</h2>
<p class="lead">Once you have found the datasets that you are interested in using for your project, click “add to wishlist”. Once all datasets have been added, navigate to the “Wishlist” tab to download the data-request excel spreadsheet. 
Select the variables that you need for your project – some may require specific justification and/or limitation if they are particularly sensitive – 
and then attach to your application at <a href="http://www.dataloch.co.uk">www.dataloch.co.uk</a> along with your application form. Your application will then go through appropriate review and governance processes to determine if your project will be approved.</p>
<br /> 
<p class="lead">If you require assistance with the application process, please contact <a href="mailto:dataloch@ed.ac.uk">dataloch@ed.ac.uk</a>.</p>
